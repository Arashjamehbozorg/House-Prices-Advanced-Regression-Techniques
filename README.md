# House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques

Kaggle dataset, house price prediction using advanced regression techniques

## Key Features & Benefits

*   **Advanced Regression Techniques:** Employs various regression models to predict house prices.
*   **Kaggle Dataset:** Utilizes the well-known "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset from Kaggle.
*   **Boruta Feature Selection:** Implements Boruta algorithm for effective feature selection.
*   **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** Includes comprehensive data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering steps.
*   **Model Evaluation:** Provides thorough evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

*   **Python 3.6+**
*   **Jupyter Notebook**
*   **Libraries:**
    *   pandas
    *   numpy
    *   scikit-learn
    *   matplotlib
    *   seaborn
    *   BorutaPy

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn Boruta
```

## Installation & Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Arashjamehbozorg/House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques.git
    cd House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries (see Prerequisites & Dependencies).**

3.  **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook House_price_prediction_Boruta.ipynb
    ```

## Usage Examples

1.  **Open `House_price_prediction_Boruta.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.**
2.  **Run the cells sequentially to perform data analysis, feature selection, model training, and prediction.**

The notebook contains detailed explanations and code comments to guide you through each step. You can modify the notebook to experiment with different models, features, and hyperparameters.

## Configuration Options

Currently, the notebook contains hardcoded file paths. You might need to adjust these paths if your data files are located in a different directory.  Hyperparameters for the machine learning models are also defined within the notebook and can be easily modified to tune the model's performance.
